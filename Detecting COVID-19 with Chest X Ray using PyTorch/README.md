# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X Ray using PyTorch

This project aims to realize an image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19

This project is based on the Coursera Project Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X Ray using PyTorch

The dataset comes from COVID-19 Radiography Dataset on Kaggle
