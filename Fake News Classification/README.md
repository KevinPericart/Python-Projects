This project aims to detect fake news by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is used to turn words into numbers and facilitates the identification of real/fake news. The real news are labeled by a 1 and the fake news are labeled by a 0 in the NLP model.

I used Google Colab to train this model, that caused specific code lines.

This project is based on the Coursera Project "Fake News Detection with Machine Learning" made by Ryan Ahmed : https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-fake-news-detector
